# K-Nearest-Neighbours From Scratch

## Problem Description:
**This project is to buid KNN classifier from scratch and test on dataset.**

## Intro to KNN:

The k-Nearest-Neighbors (kNN) method of classification is one of the simplest methods in machine learning, and is a great way to introduce yourself to machine learning and classification in general. At its most basic level, it is essentially classification by finding the most similar data points in the training data, and making an educated guess based on their classifications. Although very simple to understand and implement, this method has seen wide application in many domains, such as in recommendation systems, semantic searching, and anomaly detection.
